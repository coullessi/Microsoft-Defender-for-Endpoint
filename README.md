# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - Lab
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, an enterprise endpoint security platform, is a primary component of the **assume breach** concept and an important element of your extended detection and response (XDR) deployment with [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-365-defender).<br>
Defender for Endpoint uses **endpoint behavioral sensors**, **cloud security analytics**, and **threat intelligence** to form with other security solutions,```Microsoft Defender for Identity```, ```Microsoft Defender for Office 365```, and  ```Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps``` a unified pre-breach and post-breach enterprise defense suite for Microsoft Defender XDR. This native integration across endpoints, identity, email, and applications allows you to prevent, detect, investigate, and automatically respond to sophisticated attacks.
