# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Deployment Lab
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.<br>
Defender for Endpoint is a primary component of the **Assume breach** principle and an important element of your extended detection and response (XDR) deployment with Microsoft Defender XDR.<br>
Defender for Endpoint uses **endpoint behavioral sensors**, **cloud security analytics**, and **threat intelligence** to form with other security solutions a unified pre-breach and post-breach enterprise defense suite for Microsoft Defender XDR. This native integration across endpoints, identity, email, and applications allows you to detect, prevent, investigate, and automatically respond to sophisticated attacks.
