# Welcome: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Linux

## Introduction
:information_source:**What this lab IS/ISN'T about**<br>

**This lab is not about** teaching you the administration of a Linux device.<br>
**This lab is about** providing steps to ramp up with onboarding Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) on Linux. 
This lab exercise will also walk you through configuring MDE features and capabilities. Using a profile, you will configure MDE preferences (which take precedence over the ones set locally a the device). In other words, users in the enterprise will not be able to change preferences that are set through the configuration profile.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Linux shell commands. 
- Access to the Microsoft Defender portal.
- Ensure that you have a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint subscription.
- Linux distribution using the **_systemd_** system manager.
- Beginner-level experience in Linux and BASH scripting.
- Administrative privileges on the device (in case of manual deployment).

## Installation steps
